Reward Cycle Token About Us

A new block chain token for the Discord group he founded on May 4th, 2021, and which now has over 1800 members. The new token is scheduled to go live at the end of October 2021.

Follow the Telegram Group for the most up-to-date information on whitelist competitions, presales, airdrops, and launches, among other things.

 

Reward Cycle is the first token created by a doxed developer for our RC Elite holders. The original holders of a previous token increased it by 50x.

The Reward Cycle token is primarily intended for all of our members and the RC Elite of the future.

Reward Cycle rewards you for holding and receiving one or two utility tokens such as USDT, ADA, XRP, ETH, and others.

 
 
The Beginning of Crypto Impact (Ash), YouTube, Discord, and Reward Cycle Token
 

As previously stated, Ash founded his discord group in May 2021, but he first drew the attention of his 1800 discord members with his YouTube account, which was founded in March 2021 and has 5.35k subscribers.

The YouTube channel Crypto Impact was created to provide a look at new block chain cryptocurrency projects that are about to be released, crypto video reviews, stock market tips, trading tips, and informational tutorials with the tools needed for block chain investors.

 

To make earnings in the cryptocurrency space is challenging in 2021 where you may fear a risk of scam projects, rug pulls, pump and dumps, and copycat ideas soon as a brand new contract is released.

While Ash created an environment where investors can learn how to spot the best projects and avoid the potential failures.

 

Many of investors, traders, marketers, and cryptocurrency projects reach out to the Crypto Impact channel for content, the newest crypto projects, and hopes that their token gets reviews.

The method has proven successful in attracting solid investors who dedicate themselves to do due diligence, research, and put in the effort to maximize profits.

 
 
Reward Cycle Token Solves the Problems with Other Discord Token Groups
 

What is Discord used for?

Discord is essentially a social media platform that is shifting an aspect of social media to be less public and more private, by providing private chat rooms and communities.

The popularity and timely opinions on new projects grew the Crypto Impact YouTube channel which prompted the discord group.

From there, Ash created smaller channels inside his discord with tokens that had the biggest launches, profits, holders, and potential for investors to 2-100x.

 

Problems with other Crypto Discords?

The first objective of a discord group is to give the members a private room or chat within a certain subject, genre, niche, and so on.

As you can see there is little or no room for anything outside of the group without permission from the owners or moderators.

If you were to find a room no longer serves a purpose then you may have to go find another one, but in this case with a crypto project worth your time of interest.

Many investors encourage shilling their projects to others, which simply means sharing the project as if you do not take part but thinks it is legit.

 

So what‚Äôs the solution?

The majority of traders, shillers, and people who enter contests for these projects end up banned from the discord groups for posting any content unrelated to the project in question.

Discovering a knowledgeable and creative developer with dedicated team members and solid investors is a better use of time versus having to build many backup accounts.

Introducing the RC Elite Holders of the Reward Cycle Token
 

The growth of the discord group speaks volumes of how well the Reward Cycle is expected to do based on the success of the 1st token released by the members earlier this year.

As mentioned, a previous token increased by 50x, backed by the original holders.

The solid diamond hand holders of the 1st token, members or the discord group, and eager marketing grew the original group token with no experience.

 

The following details of the success and lessons learned, such as marketing wallet, presale whale investors, and no real use case boosts the Reward Cycle to catapult to a higher market cap with a calculated new contract.

Ash continues support for the 1st ICO but this project he wanted to keep separate and had a plan for the token.

 

‚ÄúWe needed 40 or 50 strong holders at start so price hold stable. If we don‚Äôt sell the price will go up.‚Äù In his Patreon he has 100 plus members all who signed up for the Early Bird Chatroom.

Along with some diamond hand holders in the 1st token and solid connections to good investors he knew the presale would be successful for Reward Cycle project.

 

The Discord group is still free to join, however we would like to repay Ash by joining the Stocks & Crypto Patreon, and Early Birds Tiers 1-2. Which offers you an addition way to access the RC Elite.

 
Who are the RC Elite holders? üë®‚Äçüíº
 

Original Discord members
Original Holders of 1st token (Hero)
1st Holders of Reward Cycle token (specific length 2-4 mths time frame)
Solid Diamond Hand Hodlers
üåæThis Token is totally dedicated to Our Discord Members and Holders,

 

Few Important Info For everyone:

*All Early holders will be part of the team

 

As liquidity will be locked and no dev tokens. You guys will control the token price and this token will need all of your help, such as by taking part in shilling, doing VC whenever you can to keep the group active, sharing tokens to your friends. üó£

No marketing is more powerful than words of mouth.
RC Elite can have the opportunity to promote a business, product, service, etc‚Ä¶
Kind of like the game app one of our members created as an example.
We can spotlight one or two member‚Äôs projects each month. In doing so supports the members who are in the RC Elite besides rewards. (Our member‚Äôs spotlight asks members to support but not required)
 
 
What are Benefits to Reward Cycle Token and the Future RC Elite Members?
 

Reward Cycle is a reward token and will work on a Launchpad with audit service if token takes off. It will be a simple token. Hold to get rewards and holders will control the price. We will have a marketing wallet and that will be public for everyone to see.

We can do marketing as long as we have marketing money in the wallet. We are not creating this token to make money that‚Äôs why the dev won‚Äôt be using any of his money for marketing but will use any money that comes from token back into the token.

 

RC Elite members are spotlighted as our Diamond Hand holders. They will receive the following incentives in the near future:

Members spotlight for personal projects
Higher Rewards and 1st Trade Alerts
NFTs, Airdrops, Prizes and Awards (all members)
Liquidity Pool Creation
Reward Cycle voting power
New cryptocurrency projects/ token creation
Referral Programs
 

For everyone‚Äôs peace of mind we will not hire shillers as we believe all early holders can shill for their money and we can use the same money for marketing.

The telegram group is live and we do voice chats there almost every day. When the dev does not hold tokens and liquidity is locked no devs can scam you.

 

The only time price goes down is when holders sell or dev wallets sell. Share your ideas about marketing. NOONE will hold any tokens outside presale and all marketing payments will be paid by BNB only. 

We will have just a marketing wallet and no tokens for dev. For all Ash‚Äôs work and to cover the expenses he will get 1% of each transaction in bnb that will cover the cost for setting up the coin/time/cost etc.
